                        <h3>You Will Learn</h3>

                        <h4>Engagement training</h4>

                        <p>Engagement training is a way of getting your puppy to pay you more attention and it is done
                            in a fun
                            and motivational way
                            Gaynor will be teach you how to use touch or clicker training to motivate your puppy. This
                            will
                            prove invaluable as you progress to getting your dog to walk on the lead without
                            pulling.</p>

                        <h4>Follow me</h4>
                        <p>She will show you how to get your puppy to stay close and look at you. This will help to
                            teach your
                            puppy not to pull on the lead and is also a foundation training technique for teaching your
                            pup to
                            come back to you when called.</p>


                        <h4>Play with a toy</h4>
                        <p>Playing with a toy is one of the great joys in the life of a puppy. I will show you how to
                            harness
                            this natural drive and use it to teach the pup how to retrieve the toy and bring it back to
                            you.
                            This will become a great way of exercising your pup and another way to engage with your
                            puppy and
                            get him keen to interact with you.</p>


                        <h4>Prevent jumping up on people</h4>
                        <p>This is an essential discipline to teach your puppy, Jumping up is learned by the pup at an
                            early age
                            and many people will accept this behaviour when the pup is little but when your pup is full
                            grown it
                            becomes unacceptable. I will show you how to get your pup to sit when they meet people. This
                            is the
                            dog equivalent to good manners.</p>

                            <p>Gaynor is so inspirational and the support & guidance is outstanding. With a young puppy
                                it's so
                                hard to remember everything you need to do whilst training but the patience and
                                reassurance from
                                Gaynor and her team makes training so much fun and rewarding.</p>
